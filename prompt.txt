For each sentence, create six base variations, each with three additional variants:

Base variations:
1) Baseline (SV): Simple Subject-Verb structure
2) Control (S Prep V): Subject with Prepositional_Clause and Verb
3) Standard-Subject (S RelSubj V): Subject with Subject Relative Clause and Verb
4) Standard-Object (S RelObj V): Subject with Object Relative Clause and Verb
5) Nested-Subject (S [RelSubj[Rel]] V): Subject with two embedded Relative Clauses, the first one being a Subject Relative Clause, and Verb
6) Nested-Object (S [RelObj[Rel]] V): Subject with two embedded Relative Clauses, the first one being an Object Relative Clause, and Verb

For each base variation, create these variants:
a) +ADV: Add an adverb (always before the main verb)
b) +ADJ: Add an adjective (always modifying the subject)
c) +TWO: Include both adverb and adjective

I would like the sentences to follow this EBNF grammar:

```

The terminals being *words* that you should infer from the grammar and the following example sentences.
Do not generate sentences that are too close to the exemple sentences. The goal is to generate new and original sentences. I don't want all sentences to have 'in the room' or 'on the desk'.

Output only the sentences themselves, without any additional information. Example output for one sentence set:1a. The doctor examines the patient.
1b. The doctor carefully examines the patient.
1c. The skilled doctor examines the patient.
1d. The skilled doctor carefully examines the patient.
2a. The doctor in the room examines the patient.
2b. The doctor in the room carefully examines the patient.
2c. The skilled doctor in the room examines the patient.
2d. The skilled doctor in the room carefully examines the patient.
3a. The doctor who studied hard examines the patient.
3b. The doctor who studied hard carefully examines the patient.
3c. The skilled doctor who studied hard examines the patient.
3d. The skilled doctor who studied hard carefully examines the patient.
4a. The doctor who the parent called examines the patient.
4b. The doctor who the parent called carefully examines the patient.
4c. The skilled doctor who the parent called examines the patient.
4d. The skilled doctor who the parent called carefully examines the patient.
5a. The doctor who read the report that was on the desk examines the patient.
5b. The doctor who read the report that was on the desk carefully examines the patient.
5c. The skilled doctor who read the report that was on the desk examines the patient.
5d. The skilled doctor who read the report that was on the desk carefully examines the patient.
6a. The doctor who the mother who the school called trusts examines the patient.
6b. The doctor who the mother who the school called trusts carefully examines the patient.
6c. The skilled doctor who the mother who the school called trusts examines the patient.
6d. The skilled doctor who the mother who the school called trusts carefully examines the patient.
